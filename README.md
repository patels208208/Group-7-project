# Group 7 project - Habit tracker app

## How to run the habit tracker app
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the 'habit-tracker-app' folder. Run the following commands in the terminal: npm install, npm start. This will initialise the React app.
3. Open the 'backend' folder. Run the following command in the terminal: npm start. This will initialise the local server.
4. User can now interact with the app.

# Project specification
## Introduction
We have created a habit tracker app. Our target audience is anyone who needs support in sticking to tasks/self-care. We want to cater to neurodivergent users in particular.

The concept is a habit tracker app that can be used to track a range of habits. The habits that we have chosen to develop as main components are:

1. Hydration
2. Nutrition
3. Reading
4. Sleep
5. Medication
6. Hobbies
7. Self-care
8. Pets
9. Plants
10. Socialising
11. Social media

This README.md file will explain the specifications, design, implementation and execution of the habit tracker app. This report also includes the outcomes of our user testing processes and areas where the app can be further developed in the future.

## Background
This app was built as a React app, which provides flexibility in relation to use on desktops, laptops and mobile devices. Please see below a walkthrough of how we would expect a user to interact with our app: 

1. Login page: user can create an account, or login with an existing account.
2. Homepage: this is where the main dashboard is located.
3. Habit components: user can click on individual habits and make entries.
4. Tracking screen: user can track their habits on on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis.

We have designed this app with neurodivergent users in mind. For example, we have simplified the way that habit goals are documented as 'completed' and avoided the use of multiple options/dropdown menus where possible. 

## Specifications and design
- React.js: used to build the app for deployment on a web browser. React.js allows for better functionality and smoother running on web and mobile browsers.
- Node.js with Express and Middleware: this allows the app to interact with APIs to capture/display data and a MySQL database to store the data. Within this app, we have built two APIs - one for managing user login details and one for habit tracking.
- MySQL: for database infrastructure and management.
- Git and Github: for version control and collaboration.
- Deployment: app will be used on a web browser which allows users to use this app on desktops, laptops and mobile devices.

## Implementation and execution
We used ‘Sprint’ methodology to ensure that project tasks were being completed in a timely manner. As per our SWOT analysis, we identified that some of our team members have availability during the week, whereas others do not (due to working hours, family commitments, etc.). Therefore we allocated tasks in accordance with availability, individual strengths and areas of knowledge/experience. We used our SWOT analysis to identify which team members would be best placed to complete particular tasks. For example, those who have identified front-end/creativity as strengths are working on the app’s design.

We used the following tools to develop this project and work as a team:
- Slack: we used our Slack channel to communicate with each other regularly. 
- Notion: we used a Notion board to collaborate and facilitate team working regardless of timing/availability. Edits/changes could be tracked on the Notion board, which allowed us to see each team member’s contributions. In relation to tasks for the project, we created tasks (similar to a ticketing system used in Jira) and allocated specific team members to complete these tasks.
- Google Meet: we scheduled regular group meetings on Thursday evenings and weekends to discuss progress, follow up outstanding tasks and allocate new tasks for completion. Smaller meetings were facilitated between the relevant team members who are working together on specific tasks. All meetings either recorded, or minutes documented on our Notion page.
- MIRO and Excalidraw: we used these tools for wireframing our app.
- Canva: we used this tool to create a mock-up of the front-end design of the app.
