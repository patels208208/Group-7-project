            <p>We have created this habit tracking app for anyone who needs a helping hand in regularly completing tasks, goals or self-care.
                Whether you're turning over a new leaf, making a fresh start or trying to stick to your New Year's resolutions - this app will be
                of help!
                We wanted to cater to neurodivergent users in particular, and have kept this in mind when designing and creating the app.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p>This app has been created by: Danielle, Hannah, Kat, Meg and Sabeeha.</p>
